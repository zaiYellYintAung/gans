# Ve-gans

Ve-gans is an ongoing research project focused on developing a generative AI model specifically designed to generate floorplans and architectural drawings. The project aims to advance the capabilities of GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) in the field of architectural design.

## Project Highlights

The highlight of this project is the [research paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nm6Pj3HaDo-W2HAQPPrgGqWIH74SPgQZAHxC5Uk20PQ/edit?usp=sharing) that is being written, detailing the methodologies, experiments, and findings related to the generation of architectural designs using GANs.

## Features

- **Generative AI for Architecture**: Specially designed to generate floorplans and architectural drawings.
- **Advanced GAN Techniques**: Utilizes cutting-edge GAN methodologies to create detailed and realistic architectural designs.
- **Research-Driven**: The development process is guided by rigorous research and experimentation.
