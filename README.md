# ve-gans: Image Generation with GANs using PyTorch

## Overview

ve-gans is a project for image generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) implemented in PyTorch.

## Features

- GAN model for image generation.
- Separate scripts for training and generating images.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zaibutcooler/ve-gans.git
   cd ve-gans
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training

To train the GAN model, use the following command:

    ```bash
    ve-gans-train
    ```

## Generating Images

To generate images with the trained model, use the following command:

    ```bash
    ve-gans-generate
    ```
